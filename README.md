## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to analyze the restaurant data of Bangalore provided by Zomato. The dataset includes information about restaurant names, addresses, ratings, votes, and other related details. This analysis will help to derive meaningful insights and patterns within the Bangalore restaurant scene.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on various aspects of restaurants, such as:
- URLs
- Addresses
- Names
- Availability of online ordering and table booking
- Ratings and votes
- Contact numbers
- Locations
- Restaurant types
- Popular dishes
- Cuisines
- Approximate cost for two people
- Reviews
- Menu items
- Categories in which the restaurants are listed

The data has been pre-processed to remove irrelevant columns and handle missing values.

## Requirements

To run this analysis, you need to have various data analysis and machine learning libraries installed. These include libraries for data manipulation, visualization, model building, and evaluation.

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involves several steps:
1. *Reading the dataset*: Loading the dataset into a data structure suitable for analysis.
2. *Dropping irrelevant columns*: Removing columns that do not contribute to the analysis.
3. *Handling missing values*: Addressing any missing data points to ensure the dataset is complete and accurate.
4. *Renaming columns*: Standardizing column names for consistency and readability.

## Data Analysis

The analysis includes:
- Understanding the distribution of restaurant ratings and costs.
- Examining the types of restaurants and their popularity.
- Applying machine learning models to predict restaurant ratings and other insights.

Visualization techniques are used to graphically represent the distribution and relationships within the data, providing a clear understanding of the trends and patterns.

## Usage

To run the analysis, you need to execute a script that performs data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Ensure you have the necessary dataset file (zomato.csv) in the correct path before running the script.
